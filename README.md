# üì∫ StreamReel: Scalable Video Engagement Analytics Platform

## üß† Overview

**StreamReel** is a scalable, end-to-end video engagement analytics platform designed to track and analyze user interactions (play, pause, seek) with a video streaming service in real time and batch modes. The platform leverages a modern data lakehouse architecture and streaming analytics to derive meaningful insights on viewer behavior, retention, and content performance by region.

This project was built as a simulation of real-world streaming platforms like Netflix or YouTube and aims to showcase best practices in event-driven data engineering, data modeling, transformation, and visualization.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

Modern video platforms generate millions of user events every minute. Without scalable infrastructure, analyzing this data becomes slow and costly. **StreamReel** solves this by:

- Capturing video engagement events in **real time**.
- Enriching them with metadata like video genre, creator, and duration.
- Persisting structured data in a **Delta Lake** using **bronze-silver-gold** layering.
- Applying **data transformation** and **quality checks** with **DBT**.
- Powering insights with **Tableau** dashboards to improve content strategy.

## üîÅ Data Flow Description

### 1. üîÑ Event Simulation (Kafka Producer)
- `producer.py` generates user events: `play`, `pause`, `seek`.
- Each event includes `user_id`, `video_id`, `timestamp`, and `event_type`.
- Events are sent to the Kafka topic `video-events`.

### 2. ‚ö° Real-Time Processing (Apache Flink)
- `stream_processor.py` consumes events from Kafka.
- Filters/cleans invalid or incomplete data.
- Writes processed data to `clean-events` Kafka topic and simultaneously persists raw data to Delta Lake (Bronze).

### 3. üß© Batch Enrichment (Spark via Airflow)
- Airflow DAG `batch_ingestion.py` runs every hour.
- Spark job joins `bronze` events with `video_metadata.csv` to add genre, creator, and duration.
- Writes enriched data to `silver` Delta layer.

### 4. üîÑ Aggregation & Modeling (DBT)
- DBT transforms `silver` into `gold` tables:
  - Viewer retention by video/region
  - Drop-off analysis (seek events after 50% watch)
  - Top-performing content

### 5. üìä Dashboards (Tableau)
- Connects to `gold` layer.
- Dashboards include:
  - Viewer Retention Curve
  - Event Drop-off Timeline
  - Top Creators & Genres by Engagement
  - Regional Heatmaps

---

## üß™ Sample Queries (DBT SQL)

```sql
-- gold__viewer_retention.sql
SELECT
  video_id,
  COUNT(*) AS total_views,
  AVG(watch_time_percentage) AS avg_retention
FROM {{ ref('silver__enriched_events') }}
GROUP BY video_id;
````
