Thanks for the screenshot. The main issue with the way it renders on GitHub is likely due to a **few incorrect markdown formatting patterns**. GitHub’s markdown engine does **not render tables of contents** or formatting correctly unless:

* You use correct headings without emoji/symbol prefixes.
* You use a plain list (`- [Text](#anchor)`), not hyphen-bullet with styling inside.
* You avoid incorrect styling in headers (like `## 📌` instead of `##`).

# StreamReel - Scalable Video Engagement Analytics Platform

A scalable, modular, real-time video engagement analytics platform that simulates and analyzes user interactions (play, pause, seek) on a streaming service. Built using Apache Kafka, Flink, Spark, Airflow, Delta Lake, DBT, and Tableau, StreamReel demonstrates a complete data pipeline from ingestion to visualization.

## Overview

StreamReel is a data engineering project that emulates the behavior of a modern streaming platform such as YouTube or Netflix. It ingests synthetic user engagement events in real time, processes them using streaming and batch frameworks, and visualizes viewer behavior to support content and marketing strategy.

---

## Features

- Real-time ingestion of user video events (play, pause, seek)
- Apache Flink-based stream processing and filtering
- Apache Spark batch enrichment using static metadata
- Delta Lake modeling using bronze, silver, and gold layers
- Modular DBT transformations with quality checks
- Tableau dashboards for viewer insights and engagement metrics

## Data Flow

1. **Event Generation**  
   Synthetic user video actions are generated using a Python + Faker producer and published to Kafka (`video-events`).

2. **Real-Time Processing**  
   Apache Flink filters and cleans events, writing clean data to another Kafka topic (`clean-events`) and Delta Lake bronze layer.

3. **Batch Enrichment**  
   Spark jobs (triggered via Airflow DAGs) join the bronze layer with `video_metadata.csv`, and store enriched results in the silver layer.

4. **Data Modeling with DBT**  
   DBT performs transformations on the silver layer to generate analytical metrics in the gold layer, including quality assertions.

5. **Visualization**  
   Tableau dashboards connect to the gold layer to visualize:
   - Viewer Retention
   - Drop-off Analysis
   - Regional Engagement
   - Top Videos by Genre

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StreamReel.git
cd StreamReel
````

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start Kafka and Flink

Use Docker Compose or local services to launch Kafka, Zookeeper, and Flink.

Ensure Kafka topics `video-events` and `clean-events` are created.

### 4. Start Kafka Producer

```bash
python kafka/producer.py
```

### 5. Run Flink Processor

```bash
python flink/stream_processor.py
```

### 6. Start Airflow Scheduler and Trigger DAG

```bash
airflow scheduler
airflow webserver
```

Use the UI to trigger the `batch_ingestion` DAG or set it on schedule.

### 7. Run DBT Models

```bash
cd dbt/
dbt run
```

### 8. Launch Tableau

Open `dashboards/viewer_insights.twb` in Tableau Desktop and point it to your `gold` layer output.

## Sample Queries

```sql
-- gold__viewer_retention.sql
SELECT
    video_id,
    COUNT(*) AS total_views,
    AVG(watch_time_percent) AS avg_retention
FROM {{ ref('silver__enriched_events') }}
GROUP BY video_id;
```

```sql
-- gold__top_creators.sql
SELECT
    creator,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS unique_viewers,
    SUM(watch_time_seconds) AS total_watch_time
FROM {{ ref('silver__enriched_events') }}
GROUP BY creator
ORDER BY total_watch_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
